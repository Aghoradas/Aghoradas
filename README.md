Hi there, I'm Aghoradas üëã

I'm a passionate and detail-oriented developer with a strong focus on learning and expanding my skills in C++ and Rust. I enjoy exploring 
various domains of software development, from building robust CLI tools to experimenting with systems programming and game logic.

I thrive in environments where I can tackle complex challenges, continuously learn, and contribute to both individual and team-based projects. 
With a focus on clean code, scalability, and problem-solving, I‚Äôm always eager to improve and expand my knowledge.

üå± Current Focus

    Learning C++, Rust, and enhancing my knowledge in systems programming.

    Building and refining C++ projects, focusing on performance and multi-threading.

    Experimenting with game development and interactive CLI applications.

    Contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with like-minded developers.

üîß Technologies & Tools

    Languages: C++, Rust, Python

    Libraries & Frameworks: wxWidgets, SDL2(dabbled)

    Tools: Nvim, Git, VS-Code

    Systems: Linux, sometimes Windows

    Others: GitHub Actions, Text User Interfaces (TUIs)

üöÄ Highlighted Projects:

Library Management System:

    A C++ project implementing a library management system using wxWidgets for the GUI. It provides functionalities such as adding books, 
    managing users, and handling book borrow/return operations. STILL VERY RUDIMENTARY.

Text-Based Adventure Game:

    A simple but engaging text-based RPG that I built to understand game logic and narrative-driven mechanics. It‚Äôs a great example of my
    ability to manage complexity with user input, state transitions, and logic.

Socket Programming Experiments:

    An exploration into network programming in C++ using sockets. This repository is a collection of small projects where I implement
    client-server communication and data transmission protocols.

üí° Learning & Growth

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn. Currently, I am focused on:

    Expanding and honing my knowledge and use of C++ and its numerous libraries.

    Diving deeper into Rust in general, but especially interested in system-level features.

    Contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with the community to sharpen my skills and broaden my perspectives.

ü§ù Let‚Äôs Connect

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to collaborate on a project.
I‚Äôm always open to discussing new opportunities, ideas, or just learning from fellow developers.
